FYI:

This app was created by Diego Fern√°ndez Montesinos, css was used, however I was trying to apply pandaCss but an issue happens doing it, same thing with React Query, I tried to fix it, however it was really complicated.

The app include a LandingPage, that give you a warming welcome and a login button, in the navbar user can find the pokedex, Home, login, and Infor about the author, each tab goes to a different page.
