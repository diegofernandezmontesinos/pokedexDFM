# Vitruve Technical Test (Frontend)

### Overview

Welcome to the Vitruve technical test! This exercise is designed to evaluate your frontend development skills, particularly in building a modern web application using Ionic (React), PandaCSS, and React Query.

### Task

Your task is to create a Pokédex app with the following features:

- **CRUD Operations**: The app should support:
    - Listing all Pokémon ✅
    - Searching for Pokémon ✅
    - Viewing Pokémon details
    - Marking a Pokémon as a favorite ✅
    - Creating, reading, updating, and deleting custom Pokémon entries
- **Extended Features**: Implement at least two of the following: pagination, virtualization, or filtering(✅).
- **Authentication**: Include sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out functionalities. Ensure that users can only access their data.
- **Offline Functionality**: Ensure the app is functional offline.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the app to a production environment and provide a URL.
- **Repository Structure**: Use a monorepo setup with at least two directories: "api" (backend) and "ui" (frontend). ✅
- **Programming Language**: Typescript ✅

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Ionic (React) ✅
- **Styling**: PandaCSS
- **Data Management**: React Query
- **Storage**: Browser storage for data persistence

### Deliverables

1. **GitHub Repository**: Upload your code to a public GitHub repository. ✅
2. **Production URL**: Deploy your application and provide the URL for access.
3. **README**: Include a README file with instructions on how to run the project locally.

### Instructions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: ✅
    - Create a monorepo with the following structure:
        
        ```
        /my-pokedex-app
        ├── /api (backend)
        └── /ui (frontend)
        
        ```
        
    - Ensure that both backend and frontend can be started independently.
2. **Backend**:
    - Implement a simple API using a class structure that persists data in browser storage.
    - Provide endpoints for authentication (sign-up, sign-in, sign-out) and CRUD operations.
    - Use the PokeApi ([https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/)) to obtain all necessary data.
3. **Frontend**:
    - Use Ionic (React) for the user interface. ✅
    - Style the app using PandaCSS.
    - Implement data fetching and state management using React Query.
    - Ensure offline functionality.
4. **Authentication**:
    - Implement sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out functionalities.
    - Ensure users can only view and manage their Pokémon entries.
5. **Extended Features**:
    - Implement at least two additional features such as pagination, virtualization, or filtering.
6. **Tests (Optional but Recommended)**:
    - Include tests to validate component and logic functionality.
    - Mention these tests in the README if included.
7. **Styling (Optional but Encouraged)**:
    - While not required, creative and modern styling will be positively evaluated. Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**: Does the app meet the required features?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
- **Monorepo Setup**: Is the repository organized as instructed?
- **Authentication**: Is the authentication properly implemented?
- **Offline Capability**: Does the app function offline?
- **Documentation**: Is the README clear and comprehensive?
- **Extended Features**: Are the additional features implemented effectively?
- **Styling and Tests**: Are additional efforts in styling and testing evident?

### Submission

- **GitHub Repository**: Provide a link to your GitHub repository.
- **Production URL**: Provide the URL where your app is deployed.

### Deadline

Please submit your solution within two weeks of receiving this test.
